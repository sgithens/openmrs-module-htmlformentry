The HTML Form Entry allows anyone with basic HTML programming skills and a knowledge of the
OpenMRS system to create forms. It is an alternative to the Infopath
FormEntry module in many (but not all) cases.

The key point about writing forms with this module is that you only have
to write HTML (with some special tags for things in the OpenMRS model)
and the module will automatically "just know" what to do when the user
clicks the submit button.

Currently a form submission creates one encounter for one patient.

Please look at https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/HTML+Form+Entry+Module for more details.
